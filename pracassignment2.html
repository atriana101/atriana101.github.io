The vibrant orange colors and cooler weather of autumn appeal to your constant desire for change. The upcoming holidays inspire many to reflect back on the year that was and make plans for the year to come.", "If you count the chilly months of winter as your favorite season of all, it might mean that you tend to be a bit of an introverted homebody. Donning a warm sweater and curling up on the couch with a hot beverage to escape the cold might sound like your idea of an ideal afternoon."]
